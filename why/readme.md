What is an Entity Component System?
=============================

Entity Component Systems (ECS) are a new programming model that is common in the professional game development industry, but is mostly unknown in other programming spheres.

There are lots of benefits to ECS, but it was invented to solve two main problems in traditional Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  The first problem is the Fragile base class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class) and the second problem is Inheritance Design, making it difficult to create interesting combinations of functionality that were beyond the initial design of the program.

> I challenge you, however, to name a single programming language mechanism that supports change. Those mechanisms that do deal with change restrict and control it rather than enable it.
